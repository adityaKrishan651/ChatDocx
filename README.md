## **Overview** üéØ

**ChatDocx** is a powerful AI-driven tool designed to make document interaction intuitive and dynamic. It allows users to upload documents or provide URLs for web-based content, from which they can ask questions conversationally, either by typing or using voice commands. The assistant extracts relevant information and provides responses complete with citations to ensure transparency and credibility. Additionally, the system stores and manages multiple chat sessions, which can be retrieved from a MongoDB database.

Whether you're a student, researcher, or professional working with multiple documents, **ChatDocx** empowers you to find information quickly and accurately.
